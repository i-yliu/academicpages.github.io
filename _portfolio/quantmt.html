title: "2019 Quantification analysis of microtubule in microscopic images"
excerpt: "Filamentous structures play an important role in biolog-ical systems. Extracting individual filaments is fundamental for analyzing and quantifying related biological processes.
However, segmenting filamentous structures at an instancelevel is hampered by their complex architecture, uniformappearance, and image quality. 
In this project, I propse an orientation-aware neural network, which contains six orientation-associated branches. 
Each branch detects filaments with specific range of orientations, thus separatingthem at junctions, and turning intersections to overpasses.
A terminus pairing algorithm is also proposed to regroupfilaments from different branches, and achieve individual filaments extraction.
